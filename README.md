# 🤖 Autonomous App Builder

**An Agentic AI system that builds complete web applications — from idea to deployment — autonomously.**

The **Autonomous App Builder** leverages multi-agent AI workflows to plan, code, debug, and deploy full-stack web applications without manual intervention. You describe *what you want built*, and the system’s agents handle the rest — architecture, design, code generation, testing, and deployment.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Agentic AI Architecture** — Specialized AI agents for ideation, UI/UX, backend, and deployment work collaboratively.
- ⚙️ **End-to-End Workflow** — Converts natural language ideas into working web applications (frontend + backend).
- 🔍 **Dynamic Planning** — Continuously refines project specs and architecture in real time as code evolves.
- 🧩 **Multi-Modal Understanding** — Processes text, code, and visual design inputs.
- 🔁 **Autonomous Debugging** — Detects and fixes its own errors using context-driven reasoning.
- ☁️ **Automatic Deployment** — Pushes final builds to cloud hosting platforms like Vercel, Render, or Docker containers.
